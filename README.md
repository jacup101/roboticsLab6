# Lab 6 - Automated Drones with Computer vision
This is the github repository for my Lab 6 for Robotics, which seeks to create drones which can traverse the perimeter of a room using computer vision in place of sensors. Further details, beyond the scope of this readme, can be found in the included PDFs for both the pre-lab and the lab.

## Part 1 - Normal Traversal
This part of the lab deals with the drone in only 2 directions, the code can be found under part1.py. This currently does not actually have the code to go around the room, since that would be dangerous to test, but has the capability given the correct environment. A video demonstration can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqBKJ8uYz18).

## Part 2 - Additional DoF
This part o the lab attempts to add an additional degree of freedom, allowing the drone to decide to go up and down. The code can be found in part2.py, and again does not actually fly around the room, but has the capability with a couple of changes, given the correct environment. A video demonstration can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntEDFWZ8T-M).
